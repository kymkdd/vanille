        <h2>faq</h2>
        <span class="question">whats this</span>
        <p>this is a rather simple batch/powershell hybrid that lets you make gifs in high quality pretty quickly</p>


        <span class="question">why batch? why not a proper language?</span>
        <p>multiple reasons, mostly because i dont know how to code at all lol, but batch is very straighforward even
            for someone like me with very little experience <br>
            i think working with limited stuff is more fun because it keeps u more focused on doing whats necessary
            instead of focusing on less important stuff <br>
            another reason is because its very portable and lets you tinker with it pretty quickly, i commented the code
            as much as i could but some stuff probably will be quite obscure i think sorry about that</p>


        <span class="question">why do u write like ur 13? that so obnoxious please stop</span>
        <p>its just how i type normally and its mostly cus im just so used to typing that way than any other way makes
            me as fast as a snail so sorry about that orz</p>

        <h2>installation</h2>
        <h3>easy way (standalone .exe)</h3>
        <button id="dl-button"><a href="https://github.com/lazuleri/vanille/releases">download</a></button>
        <p>this release comes bundled with ffmpeg and gifsicle directly so it works as a standalone tool <br>
            simply put it where you want and run it like a normal program</p>
        <p><strong>note</strong><br>
            i am not aware if it will prioritise the bundled version or the one you have installed on your system</p>

        <h3>less easy way (run the batch files directly)</h3>
        <h4>dependencies</h4>
        <p>vanille requires the following dependencies and will not fonction at all if they are not met</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ffmpeg</li>
            <li>ffprobe*</li>
            <li>gifsicle *<em>ffprobe is bundled with ffmpeg</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>you also need to keep "profiles.txt" along with the bat as it contains various explanations that the
            script
            loads if asked</p>
        <p>windows builds for ffmpeg can be found at <a href="https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/">zeranoe.com</a><br>
            windows builds for gifsicle can be found at <a
                href="https://eternallybored.org/misc/gifsicle/">eternallybored.com</a></p>

        <h4>setup</h4>
        <p>the setup is rather simple you just need to keep the files provided on this repo together</p>
        <div id="codeblock">
        <code>folder<br>
            |--vanille.bat<br>
            |--save.bat<br>
            |--open.bat<br>
            |--profiles.txt<br>
            |--table.txt</code>
        </div>
            <p>if ffmpeg and gifsicle are not added to your PATH you will have to include them in the same folder as well</p>
