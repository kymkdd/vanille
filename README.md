a simple batch script i made to automate my gif making process,
its quite messy and its written in my typing style (explanations as well) so it can be obnoxious to read ig

important : this script REQUIRES ffmpeg and gifsicle and works under the assumtion that :
the script is in the same folder as ffmpeg and gifsicle 
OR 
that they are added to your PATH

windows builds for ffmpeg are at https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
windows builds for gifsicle are at https://eternallybored.org/misc/gifsicle/
