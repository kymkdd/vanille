# vanille
a simple batch script i made to automate my gif making process,
its quite messy and its written in my typing style (explanations as well) so it can be obnoxious to read ig

## important 

this script REQUIRES ffmpeg and gifsicle and works under the assumtion that :

the script is in the same folder as ffmpeg and gifsicle 
OR 
that they are added to your PATH

you also need to keep "profiles.txt" along with the bat as it contains various explanations that the script loads if asked

windows builds for ffmpeg are at https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
windows builds for gifsicle are at https://eternallybored.org/misc/gifsicle/
