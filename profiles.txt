default
-------
width           | source        |
height          | source        |
framerate       | source        |
orientation     | automatic     |
loops           | infinite      |
target size     | none          |

the default profile
this converts the source to gif directly and bypasses the filesize verification
useful if you just want a very high quality gif and size isnt an issue

discord
-------
width           | source        | 400px in horizontal mode
height          | source        | 300px in vertical mode
framerate       | source        |
orientation     | user defined  |
loops           | infinite      |
target size     | <8 mebibytes  |

a profile optimised for discord specifically
the values are what i found is the max for either dimensions
useful if you just want a very high quality gif and size isnt an issue

twitter
-------
width           | source        | 600px in vertical mode
height          | source        | 600px in horizontal mode
framerate       | source        |
orientation     | user defined  |
loops           | infinite      |
target size     | <15 mebibytes |

a profile optimised for twitter specifically
values are kind of eyballed but the 15 mebibytes limit is import
this is mostly what i think offers the best quality/size for twitter and in general

custom
-------
width           | user defined |
height          | user defined |
framerate       | user defined |
orientation     | user defined |
loops           | user defined |
target size     | user defined |

a custom profile
every value is user defined, if left blank then default values apply
for people who want more control over the file
