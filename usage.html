            <h2>usage</h2>
            <h3>vanille</h3>

            <h4>step 1</h4>
            <p>simply select the video you want to make into a gif, it can be a video from a website* as well like
                youtube or twitter among many others, you can also drag and drop a file directly on
                <strong>vanille.bat</strong> but note
                that it will not work if the script and the file are not located on the same drive.
            </p>

            <p>*vanille is not meant to be a video downloader, downloaded videos are capped to 720p and deleted after
                the gif has been created.
            </p>

            <h4>step 2</h4>
            <p>select where you want to save the gif and how to name it, if you select an existing gif it will ask you
                if you want to overwrite it and take the old name for the newly made gif. <br>
                after you selected the location where you want to save the video, you will have to wait a short moment
                due to vanille needing to analyse the video to get information about it such as framerate, height, width
                and duration.
            </p>

            <h4>step 3</h4>
            <p>this step may seem daunting due to the many options but it is very simple, numbers correspond to premade
                profiles which correspond to various settings mostly related to the dimensions of the output gif and the
                maximum size that it should be.
            </p>

            <p>the default profile is “twitter” which has a vertical maximum of 600px and horizontal max of 600px (this
                depends on the orientation of the source video), identical framerate to the provided source* and a
                target size of 15mib.
            </p>

            <p>*if the framerate is above 50fps, vanille will cap it out at 50fps due to a limitation in how gifs work,
                this will not change the speed of the gif in any ways, it will just look a bit less smooth than the
                video you want to use.
            </p>

            <h4>step 4</h4>
            <p>vanille will then ask if you want to make the gif a specific length, it defaults to yes since while
                vanille has no issues making long gifs i discourage people from making ones above 10~20 seconds since
                the file size will blow up very fast. <br>
                firstly it asks for the timestamp to start from which can be any of the following (values are used as
                for illustration purposes)
            </p>

            <p>01:23:45.678 -> 1 hours 23 minutes 45 seconds and 670 milliseconds <br>
                12:34.567 -> 12 minutes 34 seconds and 567 milliseconds <br>
                12.345 -> 12 seconds and 345 milliseconds <br>
                0.123 -> 123 milliseconds <br>
                note that the only values that are not facultative depending on what you want are seconds, “12” will be
                interpreted as 12.000 seconds for example <br>
            </p>

            <h4>step 5</h4>
            <p>you now have to choose one of the encoders, this may seem very scary but its quite simple, the default
                one ffmpeg is faster but will produce bigger files by a small margin and will not be at the same level
                of quality as the gifski encoder at the same dimensions (especially small ones like the discord
                profile), this profile is better suited if you just want to make a gif really quickly or you have
                limited system resources. <br>
                the second method “gifski” is a more modern method that will produce much higher quality gifs and
                slightly smaller file sizes however it has a caveat in that it requires building gifs from still pngs
                that's why it is slower because ffmpeg simply converts videos into gifs directly, the gifski method
                requires in a first time that ffmpeg splits the video into frame at the specified framerate which can be
                a bit intensive on your resources and take some time depending on how many frames are required, then,
                gifski will take the files and put them back together into the gif file.
            </p>

            <p>vanille will clean up the temporary frames by itself once the gif is made however in the event of a crash
                during this step you should manually clean them, they are located in a folder called _temp inside the
                folder _vanille
            </p>

            <h4>step 6 (optional)</h4>
            <p>if the gif produced is over a certain size threshold it will ask you if you want to optimise it, if you
                say yes (default) it will run the gif a maximum of 8 times with incremental compression levels through
                the optimisation process, after the 5th try it will ask you if you wish to pursue or stop there, this is
                because after 5 levels of optimisations the gif may not look so great anymore but this heavily depends
                on what your gif looks like in the first place. this step does not mess with the previously made gif in
                any ways, it instead makes its own file called the same as your .gif with a “o” appended to it.
            </p>

            <p>example : e.gif will give us an optimised filed called eo.gif
            </p>
